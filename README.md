# Soccer Forecast

This Python application uses the API available at https://api-sports.io/ to print soccer fixtures/matches.

There is basic logic built into the application to determine the most likely wins.

Most major leagues are covered:
* Premier League
* MLS
* La Liga
* Serie A
* Ligue 1
* Liga MX
* Bundesliga

If you know the number of the league in the API Sports catalog, it should work!
